jekyll-multilingual
===================

A multilingual approach for Jekyll/Octopress sites

A detailed look into how this plugin works can be found [in this blog post]().
## Features

* Supports both multilingual and single language posts/pages
* Supports translation of static text
* Supports conversion of pages generated by third-party plugins (*Note: might not work in every case*)
* Supports ability to indicate a post was written in a particular language

## How to use the plugin

put the two Ruby files in your project's `_plugins/` folder.

**This plugin might not work with every third-party plugin out there.** You will need to adapt them to support multiple languages.

### Configuration

Add a `languages` array to your `_config.yml`

```
# The first language is the default language of your site
languages: ['en', 'de']
```

### Defining a language for your files

This plugin supports two kinds of posts/pages:

- Single-language (i.e. only written in a particular language, but still being shown in other languages)
- multilingual (i.e. one post/page per language.)

Single-language posts/pages have a primary language that is indicated by a tag in the post's/page's front-matter:  
    language: en

Multilingual posts/pages define their language in the filename (any language tag in the front-matter is ignored):
    2014-08-04-foo-bar.en.md (for posts)
    foo-bar.en.md for pages 
Of course this works with `.md`, `.markdown` and `.html` file extensions.

File lacking any of the above are considered to be written in the default language.

## Inspiration

Full credit should go to the [Jekyll Multiple Languages Plugin](https://github.com/screeninteraction/jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin). The translation code is heavily based on their work (and a copy for the most part).
